Smugmug => Flickr
==
This project contains python scripts for transferring images from smugmug to flickr:
 1. smugdump.py: download smugmug images to disk
 2. flickrupload.py : upload images output by 1 to flickr
 
The scripts attempt to keep photo metadata around for image filenames, titles,
and tags.  The scripts were created in a few hours to get my photos transferred to flickr so the quality and generality of the software is not all that good.

SmugMug albums are turned into flickr photosets.  I did not keep the 'key' or primary image for photosets/albums consistent across sites.

Requirements
==
 * smugmug-api : http://code.google.com/p/smugmug-api/
 * PyYAML : http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
 * flickapi : http://stuvel.eu/projects/flickrapi

Caveats
==
I was too lazy to make the scripts take command line arguments.  See config.cfg for config options.


The error handling also sucks.  During uploads and downloads, any errors result in a message to the console and the upload continues.  I'm not looking for perfect parity between my SmugMug account and Flickr; some missing photos are not a big deal to me and the cost of implementing retry queues seemed out of scope.

If you have multiple SmugMug albums with the same name, the script tries to do something tricky and create unique photoset names when uploading photos to Flickr.  I didn't really test this out so beware.

Good luck and enjoy!
